            <h2>Combustion</h2>
            
                <p>Hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume. The enthalpy of combustion is </p>
            
                <strong class="combustion">−286 kJ/mol: 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(l) + 572 kJ (286 kJ/mol)</strong>
            
                <p>Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from <strong>4–74%</strong> and with chlorine at <strong>5–95%</strong>. The explosive reactions may be triggered by spark, heat, or sunlight.</p>
            
                <p>The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is <strong>500 °C (932 °F)</strong></p>
            
                <p>Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye, as illustrated by the faint plume of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, compared to the highly visible plume of a Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite. The detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector; such leaks can be very dangerous. Hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue, resembling blue natural gas flames.</p>
            
            <h2>Electron Energy Levels</h2>
            
                <p>The ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is <strong>−13.6 eV</strong>, which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly <strong>91nm</strong> wavelength</p>
            
                <p>The energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the Bohr model of the atom, which conceptualizes the electron as "orbiting" the proton in analogy to the Earth's orbit of the Sun. However, the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force, while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity. Because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by Bohr, the electron in the Bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton, and therefore only certain allowed energies.</p>

            <p>Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, highly  ammable gas. It is also the lightest-weight gas. Since hydrogen is noncorrosive, special materials of construction are not normally required. Vessels and piping must be selected and designed to withstand the pressure and temperatures involved and comply with applicable codes and regulations.</p></div>
                
            <div class="">
            <p>To exist as a liquid, H2 must be cooled below hydrogen's critical point of 33 K. However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to <strong>20.28 K (−423.17 °F/−252.87 °C).</strong></p>

            <div class="">
                <p>Slush hydrogen is a combination of liquid hydrogen and solid hydrogen at the triple point with a lower temperature and a higher density than liquid hydrogen. It is formed by bringing liquid hydrogen down to nearly the melting point <strong>(14.01 K or −259.14 °C)</strong> that increases density by 16–20% as compared to liquid hydrogen.</p>

            <p>Metallic hydrogen is a kind of degenerate matter, a phase of hydrogen in which it behaves as an electrical conductor. It has yet to be unambiguously observed, but some observations consistent with metallic behaviour have been reported such as the possible observation of some new phases of solid hydrogen under static conditions. </p>

            <h2>H1 - Protium</h2>
            <p>H1 is the most common hydrogen isotope with an abundance of more than 99.98%. Because the nucleus of this isotope consists of only a single proton, it is given the descriptive but rarely used formal name protium.</p>
                
            <img class="isotopes" src="images/H2.png">
            <h2>H2 - Deuterium</h2>
            <p>H2, the other stable hydrogen isotope, is known as deuterium and contains one proton and one neutron in the nucleus. All deuterium in the universe is thought to have been produced at the time of the Big Bang, and has endured since that time. Deuterium is not radioactive, and does not represent a significant toxicity hazard. Water enriched in molecules that include deuterium instead of normal hydrogen is called heavy water. Deuterium and its compounds are used as a non-radioactive label in chemical experiments and in solvents for 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Heavy water is used as a neutron moderator and coolant for nuclear reactors. Deuterium is also a potential fuel for commercial nuclear fusion.</p>
            
            <img class="isotopes" src="images/H33.png">
            <h2>H3 - Tritium</h2>
            <p>H3 is known as tritium and contains one proton and two neutrons in its nucleus. It is radioactive, decaying into helium-3 through beta decay with a half-life of 12.32 years. It is so radioactive that it can be used in luminous paint, making it useful in such things as watches. The glass prevents the small amount of radiation from getting out. Small amounts of tritium are produced naturally by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric gases; tritium has also been released during nuclear weapons tests. It is used in nuclear fusion reactions, as a tracer in isotope geochemistry, and in specialized self-powered lighting devices. Tritium has also been used in chemical and biological labeling experiments as a radiolabel.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
        
                <p>In the early 1500s the alchemist Paracelsus noted that the bubbles given off when iron filings were added to sulfuric acid were flammable. In 1671 Robert Boyle made the same observation. Neither followed up their discovery of hydrogen, and so Henry Cavendish gets the credit. In 1766 he collected the bubbles and showed that they were different from other gases. He later showed that when hydrogen burns it forms water, thereby ending the belief that water was an element. The gas was given its name hydro-gen, meaning water-former, by Antoine Lavoisier..</p>
            
                <p>In 1931, Harold Urey and his colleagues at Columbia University in the US detected a second, rarer, form of hydrogen. This has twice the mass of normal hydrogen, and they named it deuterium.</p>
